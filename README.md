🧪 Stochastic AI LabA weekly collection of rare, math-heavy AI/ML implementations. This repository focuses on stochastic processes, probabilistic modeling, and industry-specific algorithms built from scratch—moving beyond standard "fit-and-predict" tutorials to solve complex, dynamic problems.🚀 Weekly Challenge LogWeekProject TitleFocus AreaDateStatus01Bayesian Price OptimizerReinforcement Learning, Thompson Sampling2025-11-27✅ Completed02Coming Soon......🚧 In Progress📂 Project DetailsWeek 1: Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit for Dynamic PricingThe Problem: Optimizing product pricing in a live environment where customer demand curves are unknown and data is sparse.The Solution: Implemented a Thompson Sampling agent using Beta Distributions to balance Exploration (testing new prices) vs. Exploitation (maximizing profit).Key Tech: Python, NumPy, Bayesian Inference.🛠️ Setup & UsageClone the repo:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Stochastic-AI-Lab.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Stochastic-AI-Lab.git)
