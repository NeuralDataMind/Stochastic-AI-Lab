# 🧪 Stochastic AI Lab

*A weekly collection of math-heavy, scratch-built AI/ML implementations.*

This repository focuses on **stochastic processes**, **probabilistic modeling**, and **industry-grade algorithms** implemented from first principles. Every week introduces a new algorithm, simulation, or probabilistic model—built without shortcuts, libraries, or superficial explanations.

## 📂 Project Details (Repo-Level)

**What This Repository Is:**
A structured lab-style collection of stochastic AI/ML implementations. Each weekly project is designed to solve a real-world or theoretically interesting problem using **probability theory**, **Bayesian methods**, **stochastic processes**, and **simulation-based reasoning**.

**Core Principles:**

* Build everything **from scratch**—no black-box ML frameworks.
* Prioritize **mathematical clarity** over packaged convenience.
* Focus on **uncertainty**, **randomness**, and **probabilistic control**.
* Create implementations that reflect real-world constraints (sparse data, noise, incomplete observability, nonstationary environments).

**What You’ll Find Inside:**

* Self-contained folders for each week.
* Mathematical derivations explaining the algorithm from fundamentals.
* Fully reproducible simulation environments.
* Clean, dependency-light Python implementations.
* Visualizations and convergence analyses where useful.
* Industry-inspired problem scenarios, not toy datasets.

**Ideal For:**

* Students and engineers who want to understand *why* algorithms work.
* Researchers exploring probabilistic or online-learning systems.
* Anyone bored of “train this model on this dataset” tutorials.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stochastic-AI-Lab.git
cd Stochastic-AI-Lab
```

Inside the repo:

* Navigate to the folder for any week to explore the math, code, and simulation results.
* All projects run with standard Python + NumPy (no heavyweight dependencies unless stated).

## 📈 Status Legend

* **✅ Completed:** Code is runnable, math verified, results converge.
* **🚧 In Progress:** Research or debugging underway.
* **📝 Planned:** Topic selected, implementation not started.

If you want, I can also tighten the language further, add badges, or generate a proper week-folder structure template.
