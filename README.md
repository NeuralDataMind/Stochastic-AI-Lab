🧪 Stochastic AI Lab

A weekly collection of rare, math-heavy AI/ML implementations. This repository focuses on stochastic processes, probabilistic modeling, and industry-specific algorithms built from scratch—moving beyond standard "fit-and-predict" tutorials to solve complex, dynamic problems.

📂 Project Details

Week 1: Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit for Dynamic Pricing

The Problem: Optimizing product pricing in a live environment where customer demand curves are unknown and data is sparse.
The Solution: Implemented a Thompson Sampling agent using Beta Distributions to balance Exploration (testing new prices) vs. Exploitation (maximizing profit).
Key Tech: Python, NumPy, Bayesian Inference.
